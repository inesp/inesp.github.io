Very recently I stumbled upon a new and curious solution to a very minor, but very annoying problem that I occasionally bump into with PostgreSQL. Admittedly, a perfectly adequate solution already exists for this problem and Postgres's limitations of the `GROUP BY`-logic, which are causing this problem make perfect sense to me and I support them fully. *But* (and doesn't every rule always trigger a *"but can you make an exception this time"*), I never liked that solution, because it is so verbose and difficult to read. Is there a better way?

## How to select additional columns when using GROUP BY together with MAX/MIN

(For the purposes of this story, ) I am a wildlife researcher and I count how many animals live where. I also have a small Postgres table, where I record the number of animals I've counted. Here it is:

| animal_id | num_of_animals | area |
|-----------|----------------|------|
| 1         | 120            | A    |
| 1         | 80             | B    |
| 1         | 10             | C    |
| 2         | 50             | A    |
| ...       | ...            | ...  |
{:.table-small}

And now somebody asks me: **"For every animal, can you tell me which area they prefer?"**.

Ok, I can do it. I need to `GROUP BY animal_id` and call `MAX(num_of_animals)`:

```sql
select
	animal_id,
	MAX(num_of_animals) as max_num
from
	animals
group by
	animal_id
```

But how do I get the area? How do I get the value of the area column, in the same row as the `MAX(...)` is found?

I can't just add `, area_code` to the list of `SELECT` columns, because I will get the error: `column "animals.area_code" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function`. And this makes sense, but unfortunatelly no aggregate function exists that could do what I want it to. I don't want to know the `MAX(area_code)`, nor the `COUNT(area_code)`, I want to know something like this `SAME_ROW_VALUE(area_code, column=max_num)`.


### The standard solution (and possibly the fastest, most optimized and most boring solution of them all)

One of the standard solutions is to use a subquery: we `INNER JOIN` the 1st query with the `animals` table to identify the rows where the `animal_id` and `max_num` match:

```sql
select
	animals.animal_id,
	max_num,
	area_code
from
	animals
inner join (
	select
		animal_id,
		MAX(num_of_animals) as max_num
	from
		animals
	group by
		animal_id) as max_num_of_animals
  on
	  animals.animal_id = max_num_of_animals.animal_id
	  and animals.num_of_animals = max_num_of_animals.max_num
```

Let me be honest here, if you have a huge table with lots of data and you care about speed, then you should first profile the results of this solution. Chances are this on is perfectly adequate, maybe even awesome, but to paraphrase my (usually very soft spoken) friend: *"PROFILE YOUR QUERIES ON YOUR ACTUAL DATA before making a decision"*.

But, if this long-winded letter of a SELECT-statement irks you out, let me introduce you to other, more funky solutions 😏.


### My favorite solution (very hacky, but so short)

Here is the solution I like better. I'd like to emphasize I am not the author of the idea, I am just spreading the word. I found this solution in a StackOverflow post, but I don't know which one and I've just spent half an hour searching StackOverflow for it with no luck.

So, here is my favorite solution.

```sql
select
	animal_id,
	MAX(num_of_animals),
	SUBSTRING(MAX(CONCAT(to_char(num_of_animals, '0000000000'), area_code)), 12) AS "area_code"
from
	animals
group by
	animal_id
```

I know, that additional `SUBSTRING(MAX.....` demands some explanation. 😁

1. `to_char(num_of_animals, '0000000000')`: we turn `num_of_animals` into a string with zeros at the begining like so: `0000000120`, `0000000080`, ..
   The string `0000000000` must have as many zeros as the biggest `num_of_animals` can have digits.
2. `CONCAT(..., area_code)`: we append the area_code to the back like so: `0000000120A`, `0000000080B`, ...
3. `MAX(..)`: we find the maximum values of these strings. Because the strings start with `num_of_animals`, their MAX will be the same as the MAX of `num_of_animals`.
4. `SUBSTRING(..)`: we strip away zeros and the `num_of_values` to get only the `area_code`: `SUBSTRING(0000000120A, 12) => A`. ATTENTION: `to_char` creates white space at the beginning of the string, so we have to substract 12 chars, not just 10.

I personally, like this approach, but again *"PROFILE YOUR QUERIES ON YOUR ACTUAL DATA before making a decision"*. It all depends on your data, the size of your table, the data types of your columns, your hardware, ...

### My friend's solution (because "the above solution is so hacky, that it should only be used in the context of MySQL" :P - hat tip to MySQL for being the most popular database platform)

```sql
SELECT
 DISTINCT animal_id,
 first_value(area_code_2) OVER win AS area_code,
 first_value(num_of_animals) OVER win AS num_of_animals
FROM
 animals
 WINDOW win AS (
	 PARTITION BY animal_id
   ORDER BY
   num_of_animals DESC)
```

This one is definitely very sleek and concise, but demands more advanced knowledge, because it replaces `GROUP BY` with a window function. Here is how it works.

We start with a very simple, self-explanatory SELECT statement: `select distinct animal_id from animals`.

Then we add a window functions, for which Postgres uses the name `PARTITION`s. Window functions do 2 things: first they create a subset of the table rows and then they perform some calculation on the subset. It is important to note that a different subset is created for every row of the original `SELECT` statement. In our case, the window will always hold all the rows that have the same `animal_id` as is the `animal_id` in the original `SELECT` (=`PARTITION BY animal_id`). And the calculation in our case is `first_value(num_of_values)`, so the `num_of_values` from the first row in the window subset.

This is what window functions will see in our case:

![Postgres window function](/assets/Postgres-window.jpg)

Because we also order the values in each partition (=`ORDER BY num_of_animals DESC`), the first row will always be the one we want.

This is it, 3 quite different ways to get the same data from the DB.

And this is is as good a proof as any that programming is a weird combination of precise machine manipulations and free-style art creation.
