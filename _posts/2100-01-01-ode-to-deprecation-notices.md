title: "Ode to Deprecation Warnings"
---

You know what's great? It's that you don't have to write all the code yourself, you can just use open source libraries. There's a bunch of them, just download them and call their super-awesome functions.

And then... in 6, 12 or 48 months, you'll have a great collection of outdated libs in your project that need upgrading. You won't remember what those libs too precisely nor how they do it nor how you need to change your code around calling them to make it work with the new versions. Great!

A thing that comes to the rescue is.... deprecation notices.

Can we please have more of them?!?!!! :pray:

You can't expect me to read your carefully crafted blog posts about the changes to your library, because I'm using like 200 libraries in my project. 

So, just sprinkle a few deprecation notices to your code as you go about making breaking changes. That is SO MUCH KINDER to my effort!
