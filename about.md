Hi, I’m Ines Panker. I'm a software engineer and Python consultant helping teams bring clarity to complex systems.

My work spans architecture, backend development, and guiding teams through technical decisions. I began with **Java**, spent time in the world of PHP, and eventually focused my practice on **Python**, which has been at the centre of my work for several years now.

I’m particularly interested in **simplifying complexity**: **improving existing codebases, clarifying system structure, and finding practical, maintainable solutions** to problems that have grown unwieldy over time. 

To me, great software systems are like well-designed cities: thoughtfully planned, easy to navigate, and built to scale gracefully. The key is building solid **foundations** and to focus on what genuinely matters to the people using and maintaining the system.

I’m also drawn to the **human side** of software. Software reflects the people who build it, those who use it, and the society it exists in. I try to explore how technical decisions and human dynamics influence each other.

In my talks and writing, I aim to make complex ideas clear and relevant, blending technical insight with a focus on the people around the code.

If you’re working with Python and need support with architecture, refactoring, or making sense of complexity, I’m available for consulting and short-term collaborations.
