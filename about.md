Hi, my name is Ines Panker. I'm a software engineer by profession and an explorer by spirit. 

I'm currently making my living as a Python Web Developer and a Mentor for everything software-related. My forte is finding patters, which I use to excel at refactoring legacy code, uncovering bugs and identifying edge cases. But I also love to share knowledge, which is why I love giving lectures and workshops and why I always try to leave code a bit more readable than I found it.
