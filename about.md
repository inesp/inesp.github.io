Hi, my name is Ines Panker. I'm a software engineer by trade and an explorer at heart. 

I'm currently making my living mostly as a Python Web Developer and a mentor for everything software-related. 

My forte is **finding patters**.... in code, in systems, in data and in people. Must not forget the people ðŸ˜‰.

<small>- *I hate writing about myself. I've been writing this page for 5 years now. Even in the age of ChatGPT I still can't find the words to describe myself. The right words keep eluding me.*</small>

I'm good at organizing chaos and also good at simplifying complexity to just the right level for every situation. 

**Think of me as the chaos whisperer.** I'm turning wild messes into smooth, scalable systems. 

The best code systems are like well-designed cities: carefully planned, easy to navigate, and capable of growing without falling apart. The catch is to build **foundations** while creating solutions.

My other passion lies with ***people*** and our motivations as we interact with code.

It all started with in a wrong lecture hall. I was heading to a lecture about some "very important, backend stuff" and ended up
in the wrong room, where somebody just casually gave the best talk of the conference, 
a talk about intuitive design to a half empty room.

And since then I can't stop thinking about: What's the point of the code we write? Who is it for? 
What do they want and need from the software? How can we make it easier for them to use it?

But once you start thinking about people, you eventually realize developers and managers are also people.

So, what do they want and need from code? Can we build code systems that take care of the bureaucratic aspects of code interactions: **let's automate everything** that isn't fun to do manually. Technology must work for us, not we for it. How do you build a **community**, a true team of people to replace the often autocratic default relationships inside companies? 

What about the on-lookers?
What is the point of the media in this whole equation? 
Which **lies** are we telling ourselves and which do we gladly hear from industry leaders?

There are a million facets to building software. **My focus is creating solid architecture, maintainable, scalable and efficient while ensuring it aligns with the business goals and prioritizes users' needs.**
