Hi, my name is Ines Panker. I'm a software engineer by trade and an explorer at heart. 

I'm currently making my living mostly as a Python Web Developer and a mentor for everything software-related. 

My forte is **finding patters**.... in code, in systems, in data and in people. Must not forget the people ðŸ˜‰.

<small>- *I hate writing about myself. I've been writing this page for 5 years now. Even in the age of ChatGPT I still can't find the words to describe myself. The right words keep eluding me.*</small>

I'm good at organizing chaos and also good at simplifying complexity to just the right level for every situation. 

**Think of me as the chaos whisperer.** I'm turning wild messes into smooth, scalable systems. 

The best code systems are like well-designed cities: carefully planned, easy to navigate, and capable of growing without falling apart. The catch is to build **foundations** while creating solutions.

My other passion lies with ***people*** and our motivations as we interact with code.

It started with a simple focus on the user: What's the point of the code we write? The settings should be minimal, the buttons intuitive, the design self-explanatory.

But then it expanded to developers and managers. How do you build code systems that take care of the bureaucratic aspects of code interactions: **let's automate everything** that isn't fun to do manually. Technology must work for us, not we for it. How do you build a **community**, a true team of people to replace the often autocratic default relationships inside companies? 

And what's the point of the media in this whole equation? Which **lies** are we telling ourselves and which do we gladly hear from industry leaders? What is our future?

There are a million facets to building software. **I focus on creating solid architectures, maintainable, scalable and efficient while ensuring they align with the business goals and prioritize user needs.**
