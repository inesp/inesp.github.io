Hi, my name is Ines Panker. I'm a Software Engineer by trade and an explorer at heart.

I've been building software **for almost two decades**: writing code, shaping architecture, and leading teams. I started my journey with **Java**, surfed the PHP wave, and for the past decade, **Python** has been my weapon of choice.

&nbsp;

I’m fascinated by elegant solutions to complex problems, **finding simple, straightforward patterns in** what might initially seem like **chaos**. You could say I’m an **interpreter of complexity**, helping make sense of tangled codebases and intricate systems.

To me, great software systems are like well-designed cities: thoughtfully planned, easy to navigate, and built to grow without falling apart. The key is building solid **foundations** while delivering real-world solutions.

My other passion is observing the **human side** of software.

While the industry often treats code as the center of everything, I see software as deeply human: created by teams, used by people, and shaped by the society we live in.

There are many facets to building software. It starts long before we open a code editor. It starts in meeting rooms, meetups, and conferences. It continues well after we close the editor by living on in the hands of users and society.

In my talks and writing, I aim to make complex ideas clear and relevant, blending technical insight with a focus on the people around the code.
