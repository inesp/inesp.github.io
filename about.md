Hi, my name is Ines Panker. I'm a software engineer by trade and an explorer at heart.

I've been building software **for almost 2 decades**. In the last 10 years focusing on **Python**.

I'm fascinated by elegant solutions to complex problems, **finding simple, straightforward patterns in** what at first glance appears to be **unorganized chaos**. 

At the beginning, code often takes the form of 50 if-statements one after the other, but then it must evolve towards systems that hold their own meaning inside themselves, **systems that are intuitive to use and intuitive to maintain and extend**.

**Think of me as the chaos whisperer.** I'm turning wild messes into smooth, scalable systems. 

The best code systems are like well-designed cities: carefully planned, easy to navigate, and capable of growing without falling apart. The catch is to build **foundations** while creating solutions.

My other passion is to observe the **human aspect** of software. 

The IT profession wants to give the impression that code is at the center of everything, technical details rule our world. But as soon as you look closer, you can find **humans everywhere** - we build software for people to use it, we build software in teams of people, we are being watched by the society of people while we built it.

Building software is a deeply human endeavor. 

The questions start with: Who will use this code and how? How will they try to abuse it? 

But then quickly and silently transition into questions about our teams: How do I make other devs abopt new coding principals? How do I make the manager see that security is also essential and PR reviews prevent bugs? 

And then gradually we also see that society is watching: Why is my doctor tentatively asking  me if AI will replace her? The news is talking about drones sending medicine to remote areas, is my code running on them?

There are a million facets to building software. Building software starts way before we open a code editor, it starts already in various meeting rooms and in meetups and conferences. And it ends way after we close the code editor, it ends in the hands of the users, in the hands of the society.

**My focus is thus creating solid architecture, maintainable, scalable, safe and efficient while ensuring it aligns with the business goals and prioritizes users' needs.**
