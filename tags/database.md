It's hard to write about databases... because it always ends up a boring read. I don't know what it is about databases, but every time there is a problem and I get called in to solve it and I do solve it and I admire my extraordinarily clever solution, I just can't find the words to explain it to you, to properly paint the picture and not put you into the deepest of sleeps. 

Database problems seem to be always just the most specific problems, applicable only this one time, on this one table, at this one organization.
