## Software Estimation is a Delusion (Extended Version)

**Status:** Delivered multiple times, available for booking

### Abstract
Software estimation has become the holy grail of project management, yet it consistently fails us. In this talk, we'll explore why estimation is fundamentally flawed, how it's often misused as a tool for control rather than planning, and what we can do instead. Drawing from real-world examples and cognitive biases, we'll examine why developers struggle with estimation and how organizations can build better planning processes.

### Notes
- 45-60 minute version available with extended Q&A
- Includes interactive polling sections
- Works well for both technical and mixed audiences
- Can be customized for specific industries

### Materials

## The Psychology of Code Reviews

**Status:** In development

### Abstract
Code reviews are supposed to catch bugs and improve code quality, but they often become battlegrounds of egos and nitpicking. This talk explores the psychological dynamics at play during code reviews - from confirmation bias to the sunk cost fallacy - and provides practical strategies for making code reviews more effective and less adversarial. We'll cover how to give constructive feedback, receive criticism gracefully, and build a culture where code reviews actually improve both code and team dynamics.

### Notes
- Interactive workshop version available (2-3 hours)
- Includes practical exercises and role-playing
- Best suited for teams with existing code review processes
- Can include company-specific examples with advance notice

### Materials
- Slides: In development
- Workshop materials: Available upon request

## Debugging Your Team: A Developer's Guide to People Problems

**Status:** Concept stage

### Abstract
As developers, we're great at debugging code - we have systematic approaches, tools, and methodologies. But when it comes to team problems, we often wing it. This talk applies debugging principles to common team issues: unclear requirements (race conditions), scope creep (memory leaks), and communication breakdowns (deadlocks). Learn how to apply your technical problem-solving skills to create better working relationships and more effective teams.

### Notes
- Highly interactive format with audience participation
- Uses familiar technical metaphors to explain soft skills
- Ideal for senior developers moving into leadership roles
- Can be adapted for non-technical audiences

### Materials
- Slides: Coming soon
- Companion blog post series planned

## The Hidden Costs of Technical Debt

**Status:** Research phase

### Abstract
Everyone talks about technical debt, but few organizations truly understand its real impact beyond "code is hard to maintain." This talk quantifies the hidden costs: decreased team morale, increased onboarding time, lost business opportunities, and the compounding effect on innovation. Using real case studies and metrics, we'll explore how to measure technical debt's true cost and build business cases for addressing it.

### Notes
- Data-driven approach with real metrics
- Includes templates for measuring technical debt in your organization
- Best for audiences with budget/decision-making authority
- Can include organization-specific analysis with advance planning

### Materials
- Research in progress
- Metrics templates: Available for interested organizations
